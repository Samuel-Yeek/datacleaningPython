Hello 
Order of what I did and desc

Before all of these projects I made a script to create datasets to work with
because I didn't have time to download any and I dont think my employer wants me downloading stuff on their network.



1. AggregatingMultipleFiles
--Made a script to create 12 grade exam files for an imaginary standardized test
--Made a script to aggregate all 12 .csv files into 1 .csv files


2.ReshapingData
--Creation Script to make messy bank account csv with 3 columns [AccountID,Checking,Savings] with the balance of
each under checking or savings.
-We will change this to a Table that has [Account,Account_Type,Balance] 
--This is named ReshapeData.py

3. Removing Duplicates
--created a csv for a grocery list table with a duplicate row
--used pandas to drop the duplicate.
